docear.mail.message=Hello, \n\nwe are the developers of Docear which is a unique solution to discover, organize and create academic literature. Docear offers, among others, a recommender system for research papers that are freely available on the Web. \n\nDocear's Web Crawler found {TITLE_COUNT} of your papers on the Web, and Docear will recommend these paper{PLURAL_PAPERS} to those users whose research interests relate to them. The paper{PLURAL_PAPERS} Docear found {PLURAL_IS} \n\n{TITLE_LIST}\nWe hope that recommending your paper{PLURAL_PAPERS} is in your interest as it should bring additional attention to your research work, and you don't have to do anything for it. However, if you don't want your paper{PLURAL_PAPERS} being recommended or if the paper{PLURAL_PAPERS} {PLURAL_IS} not yours, please visit {INDEXING_SETTINGS_URL}. On that page you can change the indexing settings. \n\nIf you have any questions about Docear's recommender system, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@docear.org (please do not reply to this email directly).
